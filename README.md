# Atom Tickets

## Summary

This is a prototype of the Atoms Ticket mobile app available on both Android and iOS platform. The project was implemented using SwiftUI as opposed to UIKit. SwiftUI chooses to deploy the MVVM (Model View View-Model) design architecture versus MVC (Model View Controller) used in UIKit.

The application itself is fairly straightforward. It comprises of screens/views listing upcoming movies along with their more detailed information (if available) such as MPA Rating, Runtime, Summary, Cast, and so on. These functionality could be visited later on if desired and they are marked with TODOS and MARK in the projects.

Not all functions are implemented due to the lack of dynamic information available. This includes things such as Movie Trailers, User Information, User Reviews, and so on. This was meant more to see if an existing application could be replicated on SwiftUI with minimal customizations.
